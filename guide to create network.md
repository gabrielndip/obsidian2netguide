	    •	graph BT for Bottom to Top
	    •	Style Nodes and Edges:
	        •	Assign Classes:
	            •	Add :::className after a node to assign it a class.
	            •	Example: A[Quality Systems Senior Scientist Role]:::mainNode
	        •	Define Classes:
	            •	At the end of the Mermaid code, define styles.
	            •	Example:
                          classDef mainNode fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:4px;
	        •	Use Subgraphs:
	            •	Group related nodes using subgraph.
	            •	Example:
                       subgraph Job Description
                           B1
                           B2
                        end
